/**
 * Prompt for the comment→AI-revise loop (TASK-60, ADR-024), the plannotator
 * essence: take a PRIOR analysis + the reviewer's comments and produce a REVISED
 * AnalysisResult. Two builders share the same instruction core:
 *
 *   • buildRevisePrompt        — the TEXT-ONLY revise (no video). The whole input
 *     (overview, review_type, every task, every comment) is serialized into the
 *     prompt; Gemini reasons over the text alone.
 *   • buildReviseVideoContext  — a compact CONTEXT block for the re-run-with-video
 *     path. It is prepended to the normal analysis prompts (via analyze()'s
 *     reviseContext / analyzeLong's, using withContext), so Gemini re-watches the
 *     recording WITH the prior tasks + comments in mind. It must NOT restate the
 *     output schema/fields — the analysis prompt it precedes already does.
 *
 * Versioning: bump REVISE_PROMPT_VERSION on any wording change (mirrors
 * PROMPT_VERSION in extract-tasks.ts) so a revised tasks.json traces to its prompt.
 *
 * Language: same policy as extract-tasks.ts — English by default; "uk" appends the
 * Ukrainian normalization override. The fixed codes (category / review_type /
 * priority) and suggested_name stay English/kebab-ASCII regardless.
 *
 * Client-safe: pure string building over schema enums + the Comment/stored types.
